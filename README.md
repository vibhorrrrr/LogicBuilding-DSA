## Daily Code Assignments

Welcome to my Daily Code Assignments repository! This is a space where I upload code daily as part of my self-assigned tasks. The goal is to maintain discipline in coding practice and improve my skills by consistently working on new problems.

## Purpose

- **Discipline**: By committing to upload code every day, I ensure a regular practice routine.
- **Skill Improvement**: Regular coding helps me learn new concepts and solidify my understanding of existing ones.
- **Dry Run Practice**: I intentionally do not provide the questions or problem statements for the code. This encourages you to dry run the code mentally, which is a valuable skill for understanding and debugging code.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the code files. If you want to practice, you can:

1. **Dry Run**: Go through the code line by line in your mind and predict what it does.
2. **Execute**: Run the code to see if your predictions were correct.
3. **Modify**: Try to modify the code or extend its functionality to deepen your understanding.

## Structure

- Each file is named in the format `assignment1a.c`, `assignment2b.c` - basically it goes `assignment<assignment_number><a, b, c, d, or e>.<extension>`.
- The code may cover various topics, including algorithms, data structures, and other programming concepts.
- The code is written either in C or C++ or Java.

## Contributions

If you have suggestions or improvements for the code, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request. Collaboration and feedback are always welcome!

## License

This repository is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to use the code for your personal practice and learning.
